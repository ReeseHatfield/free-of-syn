# free of syn

Rid your rust crate of [syn](https://crates.io/crates/syn)!

"free of syn" is a movement â€” Rust crates shouldn't take forever to build.

And often, the culprit is proc macro crates that pull in heavy dependencies
like [syn](https://crates.io/crates/syn).

## What's the alternative?

Declarative macros (much faster, and cacheable!) may be more capable than
you realize!

  * Read [The Little Book of Rust Macros](https://veykril.github.io/tlborm/)

If you _have_ to use proc macros, then you may be interested in
[unsynn](https://crates.io/crates/unsynn), which allows writing proc-macro
parsers without heavy dependencies.

## Enforce it in CI

To make sure your crate is free of syn, run the provided `absolve.sh` script
in your CI pipeline.

Here's just the badge, as ANSI escapes:

```raw
\033[38;2;255;255;255;48;2;0;0;0m free of \033[38;2;255;255;255;48;2;255;105;180m syn \033[38;2;255;255;255;48;2;0;0;0m\033[0m
```

It renders as:

Alternatively, the [`cargo-deny`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny)
plugin lets you ban arbitrary crates.

## Spread the word

If you have a crate that's free of syn, you can display your support for
the "free of syn" campaign with a badge:

```markdown

```
